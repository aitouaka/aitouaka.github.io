I'm excited to share my experience with the [HTB CWES](https://academy.hackthebox.com/achievement/badge/d4c4aecf-97a5-11f0-9254-bea50ffe6cb4) exam, formerly known as CBBH. After weeks of preparation, I successfully passed the exam and earned the certification. This achievement validates my skills in web exploitation and cybersecurity. My next target: CPTS!
