I‚Äôm passionate about cybersecurity, DevSecOps, and hands-on problem solving. I enjoy exploring how systems, applications, and networks behave ‚Äî from setting up secure environments to simulating attacks and creating better defenses.

My work blends **offensive and defensive security** with **DevSecOps practices**. I automate security testing, integrate tools into CI/CD pipelines, and promote secure-by-design principles. Whether I‚Äôm scripting, auditing code, or analyzing infrastructure, my goal is to find practical and sustainable solutions.

I believe in sharing knowledge, building useful tools, and helping teams make security an everyday habit. All testing and demonstrations I describe are conducted in authorized, controlled environments.
